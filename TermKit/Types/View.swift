/**
 * View is the base class for all views on the screen and represents a visible element that can render itself and contains zero or more nested views.
 *
 * The View defines the base functionality for user interface elements in TermKit.  Views
 * can contain one or more subviews, can respond to user input and render themselves on the screen.
 *
 * Views can either be created by setting the X, Y, Width and Height properties on the view.    Coordinates are relative
 * to the container they are being added to.
 *
 * The `x`, and `y` properties are of type `Pos`, and you can use either absolute positions, percentages or anchor
 * points
 *
 * The `width` and `height` properties are of type `Dim`
 * and can use absolute position, percentages and anchors.   These are useful as they will
 * take care of repositioning your views if your view's frames are resized or if the
 * terminal size changes
 *
 * Subviews can be added to a View by calling the `addSubview` method.   The container of a view is the
 * Superview.
 *
 * Developers can call the `setNeedsDisplay` method on the view to flag a region or the entire view
 * as requiring to be redrawn.
 *
 * Views have a ColorScheme property that defines the default colors that subviews
 * should use for rendering.   This ensures that the views fit in the context where
 * they are being used, and allows for themes to be plugged in.   For example, the
 * default colors for windows and toplevels uses a blue background, while it uses
 * a white background for dialog boxes and a red background for errors.
 *
 * If a ColorScheme is not set on a view, the result of the ColorScheme is the
 * value of the SuperView and the value might only be valid once a view has been
 * added to a SuperView, so your subclasses should not rely on ColorScheme being
 * set at construction time.
 *
 * Using ColorSchemes has the advantage that your application will work both
 * in color as well as black and white displays.
 *
 * Views that are focusable should implement the `positionCursor` to make sure that
 * the cursor is placed in a location that makes sense.   Unix terminals do not have
 * a way of hiding the cursor, so it can be distracting to have the cursor left at
 * the last focused view.   So views should make sure that they place the cursor
 * in a visually sensible place.
 *
 * The metnod `layoutSubviews` is invoked when the size or layout of a view has
 * changed.   The default processing system will keep the size and dimensions
 * for views that use the LayoutKind.Absolute, and will recompute the
 * frames for the vies that use LayoutKind.Computed.
